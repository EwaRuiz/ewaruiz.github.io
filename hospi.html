      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <h1>What is Hospi?</h1>
      <p>	Indoor Hospital Navigation in Augmented Reality gives users a new approach to find directions to their desired destinations inside hospitals. Patients and visitors never have to worry about getting lost and the hospital staff doesn’t have to be taken away from their responsibilities. The app allows users to download maps for nearby hospitals within their area before arriving at the hospital, navigates the user to their desired hospital, and then guides the user in "AR" to the area of the hospital that they are wanting to get to.</p>
   </div>
</section>

<!--- Problem and Solution --->

<section class="left">
    <div class="container">
      <h1>The Challenge</h1>

      <p>Most people find visiting a hospital quite frustrating if they can’t find directions on how to get to their destination and end up having to ask a member of staff for directions. Patients and visitors can end up feeling stressed when lost and for hospital staff to show them around takes away valuable time their responsibilities. There are companies that offer these services to hospitals for their patients and visitors but are only meant to be used for their own facility and the number of hospitals that have their own navigation app is limited. There is no indoor hospital navigation app in the market that is accessible for anyone to download and get indoor navigation for hospitals within their area.</p>
   </div>
</section>

<section class="left">
    <div class="container">
      <h1>The Solution</h1>
      <h2>Hospi solves this by offering this functionality in a stand-alone mobile app that anyone can download and have access to, for any facility in their area.</h2>
      <p>All they have to do is download the maps with a tap of a button, and the maps are downloaded from online cloud storage that holds map information from hospitals. Then using Google Maps, navigates the user to that hospital where the user can get indoor navigational directions in Augmented Reality by scanning QR codes at entrances, exits, and certain parts of the facility. It keeps the app plain and simple without making it as robust as its competitors and having it incorporate augmented reality features to assist with indoor turn-by-turn navigation is making it take that extra step in making sure it’s users have an enjoyable and new experience.

      <h1>The Process</h1>
      <h2>Design Planning and Research</h2>
      <p>The process to design the "AR" navigation app concept comprised of four major stages (Research, Analysis, Ideation, and Iteration/Testing). </p>
      <hr class="two">

<section class="center4">
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Discovery & Research</h1>
      <h2>User Surveys</h2>
      <p>I started by creating a Google Form survey, recruiting friends, family, and other participants through social media. The survey gathered information about whether or not users would find a Hospital Indoor Navigation app in Augmented Reality beneficial to making their lives easier. I needed to learn the following.</p>
      <p><strong>If users getting lost in Hospitals was indeed a problem; <br>
          Why are users visiting hospitals, aside from obvious reasons; <br>
          What do users do to find directions when lost;<br>
          If users would find a mobile indoor hospital navigation app useful;<br>
          What features would they want the app to have;<br>
          Do users know about Augmented Reality and what it is;<br>
          How would users feel about having to learn how to use AR features;<br>
          Do users know how scanning QR codes work;<br>
          Most importantly how would users feel about navigating in AR;<br>
        </strong></p>
      <p>I gathered responses from over 15 participants.</p>
   </div>

  <div class="container background2">
      <p class="text-wrapper">
        Key Takeaways <br><br>

        Almost more than half of the participants knew what Augmented Reality was but more than half (60%) have never tried it and (93.3%) do not use current AR apps.<br><br>

        - About 75% would check the maps in the hospital or ask hospital staff for directions<br>

        - 66.7% felt that they would benefit from an indoor navigation app<br>

        - 53.3% were at least familiar with QR codes how they would use them with AR<br><br>

        A high 80% felt that directions in Augmented Reality would be even more beneficial to them<br>

        The main features participants wanted the app to include (TOP 3)<br><br>

        - Stores the digital map of all hospital facilities in the area<br>

        - Shows directions on how to get to a specific hospital <br>

        - Guide users indoors in Augmented Reality <br></p>

      <h2>Competitive Anaylsis</h2>
      <p><strong>How would Hospi be able to stand out in the market?</strong><br><br>
        To see how Hospi could compete in the current market, I compared three popular services: Med Maps, Maps People, and Connexient Medi Nav. I compared the strengths and weaknesses of each of these service applications to see how they were standing out in the market and how Hospi would be able to stand out and have its place in the market. These three services were used to inform what features would be included in and the design of Hospi. <br><br>
        Med maps standout features were to use QR technology to start a visitor’s navigation and send them with the directions needed to get to where they want to get to. Maps People combines indoor wayfinding solutions with an indoor positioning system that can allow for visitors to receive helpful text messages to enhance their visit. Connexient Medi Nav is the is the only Indoor Mapping, Navigation and Digital Wayfinding vendor that is 100% focused on the healthcare market and used mobile app SDK + web APIs. The Connexient Mobile Application SDK and Web APIs make it possible to integrate Medi Nav Maps, Navigation and Location-based Services into existing mobile and Web applications as an on-demand service anywhere they are needed.<br><br>
        After completing research, I gained a lot of valuable insight into the current services and what features I will need to stay competitive. What all of these companies had in common was that they all were client-based, and offer their solutions as integrated maps for a hospital’s own web site or applications. The service is not a stand-alone application or downloadable app with navigation. Hospi’s stand out features are to be able to download nearby hospital maps via online cloud storage and utilize Augmented Reality into the navigational solution for these hospitals so that the users can navigate the hospitals indoors in a new and fun experience.<br><br>

      <h2>Breaking down the process</h2>
      <p>After defining the problem and identifying the solution, the next step involves design planning and research. In this phase, I was tasked with both UI & UX design. I conducted my User Research starting with user surveys, then doing a competitive analysis, creating user personas, user stories, and user flows. After that, I’ll build
an inspirational mood board, sketch out ideas and build out wireframes, mockups, and branding work that solve for user requirements. Lastly, make final iterations on prototypes throughout the process from user testing and proceed with the final results to have as my deliverables.

      <p><strong>Defining the personality of Hospi</strong></p>
      <p>The Hospi brand is simple, accessible, friendly, and joyful. Hospi's brand should stay relevant and approachable to today's audience. The design should be well explained, illustrative, and intuitive so users can successfully access important features efficiently. The logo can be represented with just the symbol for the mobile icon, or with the symbol displayed in the wordmark.</p>
      <p>“Ultramarine Blue” (#4359F5) #97003A: “Pink Raspberry” is the primary color of the brand, it can be used for the logomark, buttons, and icons. Multiple colors were used as accent colors for the brand. “Han Blue” (#3E7CF0), “Deep Sky Blue” (#00C3F9), “Very Light Blue” (#6863F4), “Rajah” (#FDBA5C)  and “Azure” (#0099FF) wear used for icons, illustrations, and buttons. “Fiery Rose (#FD526C), “Folly” (#F2005B) were also used in illustrations, icons, and navigational components. Space Cadet (#252A49) and Dark Gunmetal (#202236) can be used for background colors. White (#FFFFFF) and Black (#000000) can be used for text and secondary colors. </p>
      <p>Finally, Roboto is used for the Branding typeface and Nunito is used for the complimentary typeface. These fonts were chosen because the elegant style of Roboto matched the rounded style of Nunito and when combined with the brand’s colors gave an enjoyable, soft, bubbly and entertaining look and feel in my design.</p>

      <h2 class="special">Digital Wireframes</h2>
      <p><strong>Determining the layout for Hospi</strong></p>
      <p>I started the wireframing process by sketching my layout ideas on paper. Next, I used Figma to create low-fidelity mobile mockups that I tested using in-person usability tests. After analyzing the results and looking at feedback from the testers, I edited the low-fi screens to create high-fidelity mockups.</p>
      <h2>Low Fidelity Screens<h2>
      <img class="wireframes" src="images/hospiwf.png" alt="wireframes">
      <img class="wireframes2" src="images/hospiwf.png" alt="wireframes2">
      <p>After finishing my low-fi screens I used Figma’s prototyping features to create a working prototype to conduct the in-person user tests. I tested 4 tasks: Register for a New Account, Download Hospital Maps, Search for a Hospital and arrive at the facility, and Navigate the Hospital from start to finish using Augmented Reality. The first rounds of testing on my low-fidelity mock-ups were successful. For some of the tasks, there was more than 1 way to be completed, but I was mainly looking to see if the user would be able to complete all of the tasks from the start of opening the app to the end of arriving at a destination in a Hospital in this first round of testing. </p>
      <p>Here are the results of my first round of user testing:</p>
      <p><strong>100% completed "Register for a new account”<br>
      100% completed "Download Hospital Maps in 1 of 2 methods”<br>
      100% completed "Search for a Hospital and arrive at its location in 1 of  2 methods”<br>
      100% completed "Navigate the Hospital AR”
      </strong></p>
      <p>I felt the results were strong enough that I could move forward with the high fidelity mockups. I did get some added feedback from tests, users mentioned that it would be nice if there was a way to see brief information about a specific hospital, such as a phone number, address, and hours of operation. I considered these suggestions when designing the final mobile prototype.</p>
      </div>
</section>

<section class="use center2">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="special">High Fidelity Screens</h2>
      <img class="mockups" src="images/hospihf.png" alt="mockups">
      <p>The final concept I created for the high-fidelity mockups was slightly different from the original one that I had first thought about designing. I ended up having to modify my color palette and only mainly used types of red (red, yellow,)  and blue (blue, purple)  in my design. The background was to light and I decided to go with a darker mid-night theme that turned out to look very nice with my main and accent colors and go along with the look of the brand that I was going for. The white text helped a lot as it stood out more, because of the background being a dark color. The icons and buttons were either too small or not rounded enough to give a bubbly feel. I revisited design standards to make sure I was utilizing the proper proportions for icons and buttons. I also looked at pinterest.com and dribbble.com for layout inspirations and references. Since I hadn’t made any changes from the Wireframes, results were successful, but when asked to find alternative methods to complete the task “Download Hospital Maps” users were confused about where to click. I added an “information” icon to the right of each hospital's name in the search hospital screen so that when tapped on, users would see brief info of the hospital, have buttons to download or see the map, and have the ability to get directions straight from there also.</p>
      <p>After completing my second iteration for my high-fidelity mockups, I tested them again using in-person usability tests. Overall, the results from my high-fidelity prototype tests were an improvement and more successful than the low-fidelity prototypes for completing alternative methods for "downloading hospital maps". Users mentioned the app had nice illustrations that helped give them a feeling of joy and satisfaction. I had a few small changes to make, though, based on user feedback. In the "AR Navigation Mode" section, I added more distinction to bubble indicators so that users can tell that those are part of the screen to look around for more landmarks. Having also added the additional screens for users to see brief hospital information and to have the option to download the maps. I had also taken out some features from the Dashboard such as being able to "View the weather for the day" or see "Health News" and swapped them with features for a "Car Saver Function & Parking Planner". This helped out the flow of the app more and improved the design.</p>

      <h2>Bringing Hospi to life</h2>
      <img class="moodboard" src="images/visuald.png" alt="moodboard"><br><br><br><br>
      <p><strong>Your Features</strong></p>
      <p>The Home screen houses all of the user’s saved hospital maps. From here, the user can download maps from all hospitals within a 50-mile radius and have them displayed here, search for hospitals in the area and see brief information about them, access their profile, see notifications, check their parked cars location, and look at the map key to get familiar with the “AR” navigation icons.</p><br>
      <p><strong>Your Navigation</strong></p>
      <p>The Navigation screen shows users the nearby hospitals that are in their area and provides directions to guide the user to each facility.  Users can toggle between map, list, and "AR" mode. "AR" mode allows the user to see the directions in Augmented Reality.</p><br>
      <p><strong>Augmented Reality</strong></p>
      <p>Once the user arrives at the hospital they have the option to navigate indoors in Augmented Reality. The user scans the QR code at any entrance and after choosing the area that they want to arrive at, the app will guide them in “AR”. Users will be able to see how far away they are within walking distance, how many steps there are in a Linear Stepper, how many minutes it will take to arrive, and landmarks are shown on screen, such as, area indicators, restrooms, and blocked off zones. Augmented Reality Navigation being the top priority of the product, I made sure to incorporate all of the features, survey respondents selected for what they'd like to see in the app.</p><br>
      <p><strong>Parking Planner</strong></p>
      <p>Be able to plan your parking before arriving at the facility. Users can plan their parking ahead and be able to save their car’s parked location with the car saver function. Once the user is ready to leave the facility, the user can start "AR" mode to be guided back to their parked car's location.</p>

      <h2 class="special">Conclusion</h2>
      <p><strong>What I learned.</strong></p>
      <p id="left">I was very excited about the ideation and creation of this product. It’s something I wanted to explore and was excited to see what the majority of my user test respondents would feel about the future of navigation and the features it would need. This project was inspired by friends and family who either work in hospital facilities or have trouble when going to visit. <br><br>

         <strong>This solo project taught me a variety of things: </strong><br><br>

         <strong>1. </strong>First-hands on work with "AR" in general. I came to this idea after hearing about how my friend (hospital transporter) has to constantly guide or give directions to visitors while working on a task or how traveling doctors on call get lost also when visiting an unfamiliar facility. A friend of mine actually stated they wanted a resource like this to be turned into an app. I just thought since Augmented Reality is something still new and being integrated into apps, it would be a cool idea to utilize. <br>
         <br><strong>2. </strong>Sizing is important! I made sure to adjust the sizing of my buttons and icons to fit closer to the standards and have my design be more consistent and flow better. Taking enough time during the initial wireframing and mockup creation saves a lot of iterating and time later on. <br>
         <br><strong>3. </strong>I learned about designing for navigation! After using up all of my ideas from having used google or apple maps, I visited sites like Pinterest and dribbble to see what current designers are creating. <br><br>
         <strong>4.  </strong>Always check for every important detail during the Usability testing & early stages of User Research. Initially, I had discovered that some of my questions had been leading or biased & because of this, I had to go back and validate my findings by gathering new participants to take a new user survey and updated prototype usability test. I had learned that it is important to catch these things early on so that no major or minor changes have to be made later on when deep in the process of a project.
         <br><br>

         Overall, my favorite parts of the project were the branding and designing for Augmented Reality. I got to test out a new tough process and was very interested in bringing this product to life. Also, I gained a new experience and resource from designing a navigational app. As well as, learned how to incorporate illustrations and onboarding screens into my designs and found out that I love utilizing illustrations. I can also see this as a real live product if marketed and developed well.</p>
