      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h1>What is Physique Reformed?</h1>
      <p>	I PhysiqueReformed is an All-In-One cloud storage platform built for coaches and clients. A <br> new minimalistic designed approach for trainers to offer the best possible service they can for <br> their clients and for clients to have access to our trainers’ whole arsenal of tools and <br> information at their disposal at any location to help them in their fitness journey.</p>

<!--- Problem and Solution --------->

<section class="left">
    <div class="container">
      <h1>The Problem</h1>
      <h2>A long-time client had come to me with an idea for a cloud storage app, but they had no vision of where to take the app or what market to focus on. They needed my help to find a niche for their app and help bring their app into the market.</h2>
      <p>A cloud storage app that would have the right combination of features that could compete in the existing market, such as organizing content, creating content, and uploading files. As well as including collaboration features like, sharing items or folders with others & connecting with other users in real-time. Also, I had to come up with the name and branding for the app & whether or not it should just be a web app for desktop browsers or be usable on mobile devices too. </p>
   </div>
</section>

<section class="left">
    <div class="container">
      <h1>The Solution</h1>
      <h2>An easy to use mobile responsive/web app for desktop browsers that connects fitness personal trainers with their clients. It was an app that was meant to be usable for both trainers and clients tailored to Health and Fitness.</h2>
      <p>The application helps users share workout video tutorials, nutrition plans, workout plans, upload workouts, meals, exercises, recent activity, and collaborate with one another for group training sessions or informative talks. It was designed to be minimalistic and provide the information most needed to fit each individual’s goals. Clients are able to seek out information on nutrition, workouts, guidance from trainers and support from other users. Trainers are there to grow their business and collaborate with other trainers that share the same passion to help people transform their lives through fitness.</p>

      <h1>The Process</h1>
      <h2>Design Planning and Research</h2>
      <p>After defining the problem and identifying the solution, the next step involves design planning and research. In this phase, I was tasked with both UI & UX design. I conducted my User Research starting with user surveys, then doing a competitive analysis, creating user personas, user stories, and user flows. After that, I’ll build an inspirational mood board, sketch out ideas and build out wireframes, mockups, and branding work that solve for user requirements. Lastly, make final iterations on prototypes throughout the process from user testing and proceed with the final results to have as my deliverables.</p>

      <h1>Discovery & Research</h1>
      <h2>User Surveys</h2>
      <p>For my survey, I had 24 respondents.<br>
        Below are my key discoveries:</p>

<section class="subtext">
   <div class="container">
      <p>There were untapped areas that could be useful as a niche to break into the market, such as fitness, storage for a trainer to keep up with clients and collaborate with them or for clients to access trainer information & updates anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>With these things in mind, it gives an idea of what users want the most from a cloud storage app & would be useful when constructing user flows or an “MVP” for a starting project, such as for a Fitness Cloud Storage app.</p>
   </div>

<section id="use" class="center2">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Competitive Research</h2>
      <p>From the information gathered, my analysis was that for users depending on their needs it would determine which type of storage they would decide to use. I think if a new competitor were to enter the marketplace they could take advantage of the weakness and differences of each of its competitors. By targeting a specific niche market and taking the bits and pieces that thrive in its competitors while adding in some features of its own to help it stand out. With these things in mind, it gave an idea of what users want most from a cloud storage app & what would be useful when constructing an “MVP” for a starting project, such as a Fitness Cloud Storage app for Personal Trainers and their clients. To share content, upload workouts, meal tracking, and allow real-time collaboration with clients. Also, have the ability to create content to share with clients, such as documents, slides or videos. As well as offer a mobile app in the market, so that both trainers and clients can access their information on the go.</p>

      <h2 class="special">User Testing</h2>
      <p>I conducted a user test with my low-fi, clickable prototype with 3 users. I prepared the clickable low-fi prototype (made in Figma). The users had to go through 3 tasks, the whole task took around 5 minutes each to complete. The prototype was both held in person and online. For online users, they were given a “MAZE” link to the prototype where I viewed the results and screen recordings afterward. For in-person users the prototype was displayed on the monitor of the computer, users      used a mouse to navigate and click. They were asked to think aloud.<br>
        <br>Overall all of the participants were able to flow from one task to the other effortlessly with very little trouble on completing the task flows, so no iterations were needed to be made.<br>
        <br>Improvements to make - Keep in mind mobile Dashboard’s usability of the visual design.</p>

         2. Add a food item to the breakfast meal log for a client <br>
         3. Add an exercise starting from the client’s dashboard <br>
         4. From the trainer’s dashboard, view a client’s macros (In-person only task)<br><br>

         Overall, all of the users completed each of the tasks within about 1 minute & no further changes seemed evident that should be made to the prototype.<br><br>
         Through testing, I did discover that were inconsistencies reported by users, such as buttons and colors in the “sign-up” process. I later went back and made changes to those.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <h2>The most important lesson from this project was to always do research and user test.</h2>
      <p>During my research, I found that every person who is a client is looking for something different from a personal trainer. Some would need help with their nutrition, others would need help with their programming. Each type of client had a different need and desire for wanting to make a change in themselves through fitness for a healthy lifestyle. It was important for me as a designer to give as many opportunities that I could to help clients reach their goals, by offering macro setups, workouts builders, and a variety of different specialized personal trainers.<br><br>

      Also, it was just as important to think about the needs of personal trainers. To know what tools they need at their disposal to be able to help their client in every possible way. User testing is one other tool that helps us - UX Designers - create amazing products. I was able to see if any of the functions that I had built were actually going to be usable for my users.<br><br>

      Without having conducted research & user testing on both of these types of users I would not have been able to come up with a solution. The best type of research is with little assumptions as possible.</p>
