        <h1>Being a designer is my passion.</h1>
        <h2> How I got started in User Research & what led me to pursue a <br> career in User Experience Design?! </h2>
        <p>  I didn’t experience any direct problem that made me want to become a designer. I’ve always loved design and visually aesthetically pleasing art. Like most, I was first introduced to design at an early age through my middle school art class and at home drawing video tutorials. At home, I would fiddle around with technology, once I learned how to tweak my iPod. I would change the graphics for the app icons or install themes and add other features that weren’t available in the standard features that the iPod came with. I thought I was a “Hacker” haha. Art was one of my favorites subjects throughout my whole time in school, the other being gym class. I didn’t know at the time how much these two hobbies would have such an impact on my life at the time. Through fitness, I picked up the lifestyle of a bodybuilder and developed my eye for aesthetics and saw how much I applied visuals to my daily life and myself for what I’m known for - my brand you could say. All of these experiences in my life would later help me think about a career in the design/tech space.</p>
        <p>I knew that in my life, I wanted to do something where I felt I could make a difference in some way to someone or something and at the same time feel fulfilled in what I’m doing. I decided to learn more about the tech world and was introduced to all the different types of roles within, my favorite one being- Product Designer. I was drawn back to what I loved to do as a child but growing up didn’t think I could use design as a career and then finding out that I could, made me dive into the world of UX/UI Product Design. I thought not only to I get to engage the analytical side of my mind by conducting user research; I also get to use my creative side to think creatively and solve problems!</p>
        <p>When I began in my journey to learn about the field of Product Design, I have developed a curiosity about a user’s unique perspective when interacting with a product. I’ve learned that design can be used in many ways to make a difference in the world. I don’t know if I can change the future through design. I only know that I will help others with my designs to create something that can potentially have an influence on others or make a change in some way to solve problems that’s others cannot alone. I have over 5 plus years of working with customers in retail & sales that have allowed me to develop a good understanding of what empathy is and how it is needed for human-centered design. I realized that this career encompassed all of my favorite things into one job. So that’s why I decided to dive right into this career path where I would be able to utilize my new found passion for user-centered design to help me solve problems for businesses and users by satisfying their needs with innovative solutions.. so what better way to that, than to become a Product Designer!</P>
